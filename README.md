Ques1:: It is the solution to problem number one. I have written by using my own intuition.
Ques2: It is the solution to problem number two. This question has two-part so the first part is in question number 2 and the second part could be seen on command by typing ./hello which shows merged CSV file of test1.csv and test2.csv.

Question third: Sir, I am trying my best to design it. but not perfect. If I have some prior knowledge about designing especially in networking then damn sure I can do it with full confidence.

Please see my result and consider me once.
I am passionate about my work. I will do my best every time.

Note: "I am really passionate for working in this defence tech. Give me chance to work with you".

If any further round of coding or anything else, then I am ready sir.
